            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I graduated from UCLA in 2016 with a Global Studies Major and a Japanese Language Minor. 
                Soon after, I found work at Gromax Enteprises Corp where due to its small nature, I helped out in many fields including Accounting, Logistics, Shipping, Customer Service, and IT.
                It was through IT where I decided to pursue a career in the tech industry. Despite my lack of experience, I found that I would spend hours trying to find bugs or learning
                how the servers worked. As my love for the field increased, so did my hours spent on coding. I began to self-teach at home, using courses such as CS106A to familiarize myself with Java. 
                Looking for more practical skills, I entered the UCI Coding Bootcamp, an intensive, full-stack web development course from Sept. 2017 - Apr. 2018. 
                Here, I honed my abilities to become a web-developer by adapting to many new computer languages and technologies such as Javascript, React, Node.js, SQL, and MongoDB. 
                Now, having put in the work for code, I'm looking to code for work!
